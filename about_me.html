        <h4>Who Am I?</h4>
        <br>
          <p>
            I am a student of the University of California Irvine.
            I am an avid pursuer of knowledge and enjoy spending my time learning something new and expierencing the world in new ways.
            From a young age I also had a morbid curiousity for the mechanisms behind technology.
            I would play around with a hammer. Find some old, mechanical thing to smash open.
            Staring inside trying to find the answers.
            From these early stages I had always known that engineering was an innate feature of myself.
            And along the way, from my early childhood roots to teenage youth, I had shifted between Aerospace, Computer, and Mechanical Engineering.
            I finally settled towards computers.
            They really began fascinating me, with the start of my first programming class
            , occuring my senior year of high school. I had always loved computers but a new world was exposed to me
            when the backdoor of most modern technologies was shown to me.
            From there, I chose to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering, and plan to explore
            the world with a computer at the heart of my ability to transform it.
