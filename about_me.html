        <h4>Who Am I?</h4>
        <br>
          <p>
            I am a student of the University of California Irvine. I am an avid pursuer of knowledge and enjoy spending my time learning something new and experiencing the world in new ways. From a young age I also had a morbid curiosity for the mechanisms behind technology. From these early stages I had always known that engineering was an innate feature of myself. And along the way, from my early childhood roots to teenage youth, I had shifted between Aerospace, Computer, and Mechanical Engineering. I finally settled towards computers. They really began fascinating me, with the start of my first programming class, occuring my senior year of high school. I had always loved computers but a new world was exposed to me when the backdoor of most modern technologies was shown to me. From there, I chose to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering, and plan to explore the world with a computer at the heart of my ability to transform it.

              <p>
                A community outreach program to help expose high school students to the world of engineering by providing them with a curriculum to develop their own circuits and code. Our goal is to make sure that students that attend under resourced technological schools can have the same opportunities that students in well financed schools receive. We are trying to remove the disparity between these schools, and make sure that all schools are able to get access to computer science and electrical engineering programs.

                    IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu (IEEE-HKN) is the honor society of IEEE.  It promotes excellence in the profession and in education with ideals of Scholarship, Character, and Attitude.It was founded on 28 October 1904 for students of electrical engineering.  Today, IEEE-HKN promotes professional accomplishment, service, and development for students and professionals in electrical engineering, computer engineering, and other IEEE fields of interest.

                      The ZotBins System is an ongoing project with a team of 11 people. The Zotbins System is website with â€œsmart binsâ€ deployed in various locations (i.e. buildings, college campuses, cities) that can accurately measure and record the amount of waste in each bin. The main purpose of this project is to help keep communities clean, make waste management more efficient, and encourage the practice of zero waste (diverting waste away from landfill). I worked on the hardware for the project focusing specifically on the weighing system and testing the various sensors that were to be implemented on the bins. I would also assist in communicating the results of the sensors to the entire team and writing down documentation to account for the technical aspects of the sensor which served the purpose of informing the hardware team, and creating a tutorial style documentation if the sensor were to be included in the final open-source Zotbins Assembly Manual.

                My time with APEP consisted of multiple research projects, and one central research project. It also consisted of performing smaller programming tasks every now and then.
                <br><br>
                The organization recently started accepting applicants who are not undergraduate mechanical engineers. New undergraduate positions called for programmers. By showing our efficiency it increased their demand for more undergraduate programmers.
