              The ZotBins System is an ongoing project with a team of 11 people. The Zotbins System is website with “smart bins” deployed in various locations (i.e. buildings, college campuses, cities) that can accurately measure and record the amount of waste in each bin. The main purpose of this project is to help keep communities clean, make waste management more efficient, and encourage the practice of zero waste (diverting waste away from landfill). The 3 core features of this project are (1) to collect real-time data, (2) to manage a leaderboard system, and (3) to provide waste guidance. Collecting real-time data on bin fullness and weight of waste of each smart bin provides facilities management or city planners to calculate useful statistics (e.g. divergence rates or bin usage frequency). It also helps determine the efficacy of certain zero waste resources (e.g. more signage, trash sorters, different bin designs, etc.).            </p>

            <h2><strong>Design</strong></h2>
              <p>
                The project was separated into 2 teams, hardware and software. I was apart of the hardware team. While on the project research was done on the sensors that would be used : ultrasonic, IR Break Beam, and load cells. There were plenty of open source material on how to work the sensors which was important because the Zotbins project is designed to be open-source and simple to implement for other students.               </p>
            <br>
            <h2><strong>Skills</strong></h2>
              <p>
                In this project my hardware experience increased because I worked with soldering, laser cutting, and general purpose tools to construct the frame and build the electronic components. I also had to document and create a tutorial for each of the parts created.
