              <b>Microcontroller</b> -
              A microcontroller is a computer that is fully integrated into a single chip. Micro-controllers have found extreme prevalence in everyday life  From toasters to fridges, from security systems to the next big children’s toy. With the invention of super powerful processors micro-controllers can provide enough computational power for most day to day tasks

              The objective of this project was to determine if this robotics kit could be utilized as part of the learning material in the 70’s series courses for introduction into the Electrical Engineering. Students selected by EECS professors were chosen to evaluate the relative importance of this project, by gauging the difficulty of the core lessons taught in lectures and labs provided by the curriculum associated with the robotics kit,

            <h2><strong>Professors and TI</strong></h2>
              <p>
                I was chosen by Henry P. Lee, a professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Although I also worked very closely with Quoc-Viet Dang, an  assistant professor of teaching, of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. We established clear communication and often talked about the work done on the robot to track progress.
                <br><br>
                There was also close communication with the developers of the curriculum, Questions regarding assembly of the of the robot were logged onto a google sheet that was shared among the various students and professors involved with this project. The sheet was then read and answered by the people over at TI. If parts were ever needed a simple parts request was submitted by the accompanying professor.
              </p>
            <br>
            <h2><strong>The Robot</strong></h2>
              <p>
                The robot uses a motor board and the MSP42 board to control the robot. It uses a brushed DC motor to move around and varies the speed in each of the motors to turn. The robot also utilizing bumper sensors on the front of the robot to detect obstacles and collisions with its surroundings. The code was written in C language within Code Composer Studio.
              </p>
            <br>
            <h2><strong>Skills Obtained</strong></h2>
              <p>
                There was plenty of soldering and desoldering that had to be done in order to build this robot as there were many connections that between the boards and the sensors. I became more familiar with soldering equipment and quickly became proficient.
                <br><br>
                More comfortability in coding with this board, and TI boards in general. There is a larger emphasis on bitwise manipulation and often requires the lense of a computer engineer rather than a computer scientist. Learned how to debug using the debugger provided by Code Composer Studio, and being observant during the operation of the robot.
                <br><br>
                This project was done in tandem with a course that I had taken that taught microcontroller systems. Things taught in the curriculum of the TI project often supplemented the ideas taught in the course. Questions about the online material were frequently asked in class by myself and my project partner.
              </p>
            <br>
            <h2><strong>Challenges</strong></h2>
              <p>
                While the circullumn supplied pertained to building the robot, it was often difficult to apply some of the same things learned without the assistance of a T.A.. Although programming electronics is not new to a 3rd Year undergraduate engineer, there are significant difficulty spikes in using a professional microcontroller rather than an arduino board.
