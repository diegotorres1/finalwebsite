            <i>
              <b>Renewable generation</b> -
              the creation of electrical energy from a renewable sources such as solar, wind, and hydro. With enough infrastructure like energy storage, and generation sources like solar panels, wind turbines, and water turbines, the entirety of the U.S. electrical grid could be supported without the need for non-renewable sources.

              Self-Adjusting Solar panel orientates itself to increase the total intensity of light that falls onto the solar panel. By increasing this, the amount of energy captured increases and solves some of the issues relating to inefficiencies by capturing light in the most optimal sense. This was accomplished by having the panel stationed on a single axis which was controlled by a servo. The angle of light was calculated by 2 opposing light dependent resistors to gather information of potential differences measures from both.

              This project is an affordable take on an existing technology that could be easily implemented into an average, middle class household. Adding affordability as a factor would greatly promote the adoption of more renewable technologies thereby decreasing the overall carbon footprint. Removing dependence on non -renewable generation is the ultimate goal of this project.

            <h2><strong>Skills Learned</strong></h2>
              <p>
                Used SolidWorks for the first time. Difficult to learn without a classroom setting and T.A.s to assist when you get stuck. Itâ€™s easy to be stuck on a problem that has a simple solution because all of the tools that are provided are so new to you.
                <br><br>
                Used 3D printers available with my membership to the UCI 3D Printing Club. There are members there who are always helping those that are inexperienced with the equipment. From their students assisted me with using the Printrbot Simple. Also received help from resident iEEE club members to help me with using their equipment to drill a hole for the axle.
                <br><br>
                Used Arduino board for the first time. Gained experience with entry level microcontroller boards.
