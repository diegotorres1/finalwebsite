              <b>Smart Home</b> - The idea of improving the comfortability, efficiency, and performance of a house. The concept is giving the house a computational footprint. The computational integrates all aspects of the house also including connectivity to other households and the city in general. Comfortability can be increases by controlling the HVAC system autonomously, efficiency can be improved with proper water and energy management. Performance is reflected in the way humans react and  perform due to changes in daily tasks performed by the smart home. This is the general definition.

              Switcheroo is a take on IOT, focusing on improving the efficiency and ease of use in a household. The basis of the project is to control standard GSI outlets from your smartphone. Having the ability to turn off devices remotely can have great improvements in energy sustainability. By making these GSI Outlet switches accessible from your phone certain devices in the house can be manually turned on and off. This adds convenience to person living there. The future applications of concepts similar to Switcheroo is to make certain switch activations autonomous. Turning things on and off should be optimized and done without the need for human intervention.

            <h2><strong>Design</strong></h2>
              <p>
                Switcheroo was made during a hackathon in a team of 4 people. Half of the team had been designated handling the hardware components while the second half had been assigned to creating the application to connect to the hardware. An Arduino Mega was used with a bluetooth module to receive incoming data from the application on the phone. After the data was received the decoder translated that information to be outputted to the any of the 8 available switches which was connected to a GSI outlet.

            <h2><strong>Skills</strong></h2>
              <p>
                Having prior experience to Android Studio assisted me with the initial steps in creating the an app, but this additional work had me learn more about user interface and design. Creating the app was a first step towards creating an application that was marketable.

                Although my role was software orientated, I also helped with the circuitry and some of the Arduino code.
