          <p>
            <i>
              <b>Databases</b> - Great tools for storing information in a central repository for quick and easy remote access to essential tabular data.
              <br>
              <b>MySQL</b> - A relational database management system is a collection of software that enables administrators of the database to alter, route, create and manage their data.

                The objective of the my research project was to bring the research organization’s (Advanced Power and Energy Program) essential data into a database for a more streamlined and organized approach rather than their current means of sharing data through a network drive. While the network drive is convenient to share information by dragging and dropping files into their respective folders, things easily become disorderly. Frequently used files become more and more redundant across multiple users within the same network drive. Files are more vulnerable to malicious attacks due to weak security constraints. Files can also be easily manipulated involuntarily providing false data sets. To address these issues, a central database was created.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2><strong>MySQL and MATLAB</strong></h2>
              <p>
                The primary use of the database is to act as a data repository for their analysis software HiGRID (Holistic Grid Resource Integration and Deployment). The purpose of this software is to advise the deployment of renewable power generation and supporting technologies based on the shifting climates, renewable technologies, populations, and policies. This software makes great use of information stored in .xls files. My objective was to incorporate query capabilities to MATLAB to interact with the higrid database.
                While software exists to harmonize MATLAB and your choice of database, those solutions can be costly. So the idea came up … why not make an effective and specifically tailored MySQL interface for the HiGRID tool for no cost.
