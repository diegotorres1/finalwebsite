        <h4>Processor Architecture</h4>
        <br>
          <p>
            <i>
              <b>ISA</b> -
               the Instruction Set Architecture is the set of instructions that is directly in control of the processor. These instructions provide the only means of direct manipulation of any computational task.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Verification</b> -
              to ensure that the correct outputs and behavior are elicited in response to certain inputs. Processor verification ensure that the entire ISA produces the correct results.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Synthesis</b> -
              The software tool, QuestaSim is a simulation and debug engine for advanced verification. A feature known as synthesis allows for a designed circuit to be accurately modeled through simulated steps to ensure that the processor is working as intended.

              This project was assigned in EECS 112L  (Organization of Digital Computers). The task was to create a pipelined processor. We were given a list of 37 instructions to implement into our processor design. The first step was to implement these 37 instructions and successfully test all the instructions given a positive table to verify that our results are correct. Once we verified that our set of input instructions were correct, we then had to create a pipelined processor design to increase the cycle speed of the processor. Multiple states of different instructions are being executed at once so registers and other logic gates are implemented to account for storing information and handling new sets of possible instruction pathways.
            </p>

            <h2><strong>Skills</strong></h2>
              <p>
                The main strength obtained from this project was an increase in organizational skills. There are roughly 10 components (depending on implementation ) to consider when designing the pipelined processor. The communication between these components are heavily reliant on the instructions that are passed to them, so you have to consider every instruction and how it interacts with the whole system.
                <br><br>
                Experience from using industry software QuestaSim to correctly model and simulate our processor designs. Simulated results could then be read and fine tuned to meet the design specifications of the project.
