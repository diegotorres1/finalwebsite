        <h4>Who Am I?</h4>
        <br>
          <p>
            I am a student of the University of California Irvine. I am an avid pursuer of knowledge and enjoy spending my time learning something new and experiencing the world in new ways. From a young age I also had a morbid curiosity for the mechanisms behind technology. From these early stages I had always known that engineering was an innate feature of myself. And along the way, from my early childhood roots to teenage youth, I had shifted between Aerospace, Computer, and Mechanical Engineering. I finally settled towards computers. They really began fascinating me, with the start of my first programming class, occuring my senior year of high school. I had always loved computers but a new world was exposed to me when the backdoor of most modern technologies was shown to me. From there, I chose to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering, and plan to explore the world with a computer at the heart of my ability to transform it.
