      <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
        <p>
        An ongoing senior design project orientated at using OpenCV and a Neural Network to detect incoming TOW missiles. The approach uses the process of detecting all moving objects on a scene, and then using binary classification to sort the objects into non-hostile and hostile. For more information click <a href = "project/machine_learning.html">here</a>.
        </p>
      <h4>MySQL Database</h4>
        <p>
        My project for the Summer Research Program for the research organization APEP involved creating a database + database interface for MATLAB, and more specifically their analysis software HiGRID (Holistic Grid Resource Integration and Deployment). For more information click <a href = "project/higrid.html">here</a>.
        </p>
      <h4>Zotbins</h4>
        <p>
          A group project to implement a campus wide, open-source, smart waste guidance system for diverting trash from landfill, informing students about waste, and providing a useful application for UCI facilities management to identify optimal trash collection services.
      </p>
      <h4>TI Robotics</h4>
        <p>
        Using the TI-Robotics Systems Learning Kit we developed built a robot to navigate a maze. A select group of students asked to build this robot to gauge how other students would perform if given the same kit in an electrical engineering course.

        </p>
      <h4>IOT Device</h4>
        <p>
        A IOT inspired project powered by a Raspberry Pi. This home automation device has 3 primary purposes. Displaying the time, gathering current weather data, and home security. By utilizing various sensors this small scale integration assists in creating a smarter home. For more information click <a href = "project/home_security.html">here</a>.
        </p>
      <h4>IOT Device</h4>
        <p>
        Switcheroo is to connect your smartphone to any typical GFCI outlet via bluetooth. The app was created in Android Studio, and activates particular channels in the circuit. The motivation of this project is to create a low cost home automation system, that is robust, and can control a wide variety of household devices. Created during hackathon.

        </p>
      <h4>Renewable Energy Device</h4>
        <p>
        This self adjusting solar panel, reorients itself according to the location of the incoming light to achieve maximum photovoltaic operation. The Arduino starter kit was used to achieve the 1-axial movement. Light dependent resistors were used to measure the intensity of the light to self correct the panel.

        </p>
      <h4>Processor Design and Verification</h4>
        <p>
        Programmatically designing a processor using System Verilog. An indepth look into a basic, yet versatile processor. Implementing an instruction set and testing the instructions by running them in the verification and synthesis tool QuestaSim. For more information click <a href = "project/processor_des_ver.html">here</a>.
        </p>
      <h4>FPGA Board</h4>
        <p>
        Tasked with implementing a basic four function calculator with basic assembly instructions onto a Fully Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board. This project gives insight into the core complexities in designing a basic processor. Designed using VHDL. For more information click <a href = "project/fpga.html">here</a>.
